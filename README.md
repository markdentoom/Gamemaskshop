# Gamemaskshop

A webshop where you can buy physical masks from videogames.

Note: I have abandoned this project due to the messy state management. I plan to rebuild the site from scratch to practice the tech more and clean up the dirty code and TODOs I never fixed in this one. I will add a link to the new repo here once it is public.

## Getting Started

First install node packages using `npm install` and after that you can use the following commands to run the project and populate/ empty the database:

`npm run backend`: start backend server using nodemon

`npm run frontend`: start frontend server

`npm run dev`: start frontend and backend server

`npm run data:destroy`: empty database tables

`npm run data:import`: empty database tables and populate them with test data

## Sneak peak

Here is a small preview of the work in progress:
